# pharmacy-management-system

## The project is an insight into the design and implementation of a Pharmacy Management System. The primary aim is to improve accuracy and enhance safety and efficiency in the pharmaceutical stores. With management being one of the most essential features of all forms providing sophistication to perform any kind of task in a particular form we intend to manage most pharmacy related activities in this system. In this project we tried to develop a computerised and web based Pharmacy management system. The system helps the pharmacist to improve inventory management, view sales reports, print invoices, etc. It will manage all activities around the shop that increase productivity and maximize profit. This pharmacy management system is user friendly.
